## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Required Assets
Place these files in your `textures/` directory:
- `AnyConv.com__IronMan.glb` - Iron Man 3D model
- `moon_lab_4k.hdr` - HDRI environment map
- `002.svg` - SVG graphics file

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Launch**: Open the application in your browser
2. **Load**: Wait for 3D models and environment to load
3. **Explore**: Use mouse to orbit, zoom, and pan the camera
4. **Story Mode**: Click "üé≠ Start AI Story" or use GUI controls

### AI Storytelling
- **Auto Story**: Click "Start AI Story" for automatic narrative generation
- **Custom Story**: Use "Custom Story" to provide specific story directions
- **Voice Commands**: Click "Voice Command" to speak your story ideas
- **Story Types**: Select from Adventure, Mystery, Action, Sci-Fi, Drama in GUI

### Camera Controls
- **O Key**: Overview camera position
- **C Key**: Close-up view of scene
- **S Key**: Side view perspective  
- **D Key**: Dramatic angle
- **M Key**: Model-focused view
- **Space**: Toggle auto-rotation
- **R Key**: Reset scene to defaults

## üîß Configuration

### API Setup
Replace the API key in `main.js`:

### Customization Options
- **Camera Positions**: Modify `cameraPositions` object
- **Animation Settings**: Adjust in GUI or `animationSettings`
- **Light Setup**: Configure in `lightSettings` object
- **Material Properties**: Edit via GUI or `materialSettings`
